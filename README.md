# Clinincal Budget App

My group members and myself have done some digging and noticed there are a few other healthcare related ideas that have been done in the past. The Clinical Budget App will allow healthcare companies to keep up with their budget. The software will monitor the incoming revenue of the facility, the necessary expensive to ensure the facility is up-to-date, employee budgets, etc. The budget will also keep the office updated on how much money was spent and on what.
