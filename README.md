# Clinincal Budget App

My group members and myself have done some digging and noticed there are a few other healthcare related ideas that have been done in the past. The software will allow facilities to keep up with their budget and would be a valuable tool. The sotware will monitor the incoming revenue of the facility, the necessary expensive to ensure the facility is up-to-date, employee budgets, etc. The budget will also keep the office updated on how much money was spent and on what.
