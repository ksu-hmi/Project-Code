# Clinincal Budget App

My group members and myself have done some digging and noticed there are a few other healthcare related ideas that have been done in the past. A software that allows facilities to keep up with their budget would be a valuable tool. This could monitor the incoming revenue of the facility, the necessary expensive to ensure the facility is up-to-date, employee budgets, etc.
The budget will also keep the office updated in how much money was spent and on what.
